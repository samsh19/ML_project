# ML Project: image segmentation with style transfer

This is the project to NYU intro to ML. The goal of this project is to combine the image segmentation and style transfer techniques to create a partial style transfer image to an specific object.

All the technique code is based on the pytorch official tutorial document.

This repository didn't change much on the original code but provide the new way to demostrate the image outcome.

For the image segmentation, the Mask RCNN is been adapted.
